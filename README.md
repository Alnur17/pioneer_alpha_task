# Pioneer Alpha Task

## Project Overview
The **Pioneer Alpha Task** is a Flutter application designed to search GitHub for repositories using the keyword "Flutter" and display the top 50 most-starred repositories. The app supports offline browsing using `GetStorage`, allows sorting by stars or last updated date with toggle sorting order, and provides a detailed view for each repository. The detailed view includes:
- Owner's name
- Profile photo
- Repository description
- Stars count
- Last update date-time (formatted as `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM`)

Built with the **GetX pattern** for state management and navigation, the app features a clean, responsive design suitable for both mobile and tablet screens. It also supports theme functionality with light and dark modes and includes pull-to-refresh capability.
